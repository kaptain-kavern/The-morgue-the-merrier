# Morgue mods
Add the possibility to bag bodies. 

Bags can be crafted at both tailoring benches for x unit of any cloth types.

Filling bag with bodies is a quick task and take place at a new building : the morgue slab. Worth to note : Bagging a corpse automatically strip it (all you have to do is unforbid corpses and be sure to set a bill at the slab - just like at the butcher table or crematorium)

A bagged body doesn't trigger bad mood (maybe they should still but less strong debuff then). A bagged body still need to be refrigerated (they rot in 4 days).

Bagged bodies can also be uses in several ways :

#filled Bodybag uses : 
    - harvest natural parts : turn a filled Bodybag into ~~several~~ natural parts (with medecine skills) : 
        + 2 Lungs
        + 2 Eyes
        + 1 Stomach
        + 1 Heart
        + 2 Kidneys
        + (1 Liver)
        + 1 Brain
        + 2 Ears
        + 1 Nose
        + 1 Jaw
        + 2 Arms
        + 2 Hands
        + 2 Legs
        + 2 Foots
    - harvest artificial parts : 
        + If possible, recovered parts should have increased infections chances
        + i was for 33% chance of destroying it, minimum
        + maybe make "salvaged bionics" that need recipe "salvage bionics" + components = functional bionics (that way more different skills will be needed - adding to difficulty)
    - turned into classic combustible
    - run a corpses fueled generator (gaz)
        + something different than CuproPanda's Corpse Generator
    - normal burrying / crematation (i would like to implement a early/tribal crematorium)
        + Add early wood fueled way of cremate bodies
#Also add : 
    - Series of racked storage in several shapes
    - A neon lamp
