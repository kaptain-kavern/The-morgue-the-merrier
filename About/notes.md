## Description
Add the possibility to bag bodies.

Bags can be crafted at both tailoring benches for 20 unit of any cloth types.

Filling bag with bodies is a quick task and take place at a new building : the morgue slab. Worth to note : Bagging a corpse automatically strip it (all you have to do is unforbid corpses and be sure to set a bill at the slab - just like at the butcher table or crematorium)

A bagged body doesn't trigger bad mood (maybe they should still but less strong debuff then). A bagged body still need to be refrigerated (they rot in 4 days).

## Bagged bodies can also be uses in several ways :

- harvest natural parts : turn a filled Bodybag into ~~several~~ natural parts (with medecine skills) :
  - 2 Lungs
  - 2 Eyes
  - 1 Stomach
  - 1 Heart
  - 2 Kidneys
  - (1 Liver)
  - 1 Brain
  - 2 Ears
  - 1 Nose
  - 1 Jaw
  - 2 Arms
  - 2 Hands
  - 2 Legs
  - 2 Foots
- harvest artificial parts :
  - If possible, recovered parts should have increased infections chances
  - I was for 33% chance of destroying it, minimum
  - Maybe make "salvaged bionics" that need recipe "salvage bionics" + components = functional bionics (that way more different skills will be needed - adding to difficulty)
- turned into classic combustible
- run a corpses fueled generator (gaz)
  - something different than CuproPanda's Corpse Generator
- normal burrying / crematation (i would like to implement a early/tribal crematorium)
  - Add early wood fueled way of cremate bodies

## Also add : 
- Series of racked storage in several shapes
- A neon lamp
